# Learn Programming with Inflex

Inflex is a system for making programs, and it has a programming
language also called Inflex. We're going to jump right in.

## Calculating

Inflex can be just like your calculator in your pocket. That means the
boring stuff like:

* Adding up how much you spent on Christmas presents: 13 on mum's book,
  14 on dad's socks, and 23 on grandma's slippers.

* Dividing up a bill at a restaurant: $351 divided equally for 7 people.

* And so on.

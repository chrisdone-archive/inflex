   contract before the changes take effect and receive a refund for the
   remaining part of your subscription.

9. **Your data:** You own the data inputted by you as part of your use
   of Inflex so you are responsible for it, including its legality and
   accuracy.

   If UK data protection legislation (including the General Data
   Protection Regulation ((EU) 2016/679); the Data Protection Act 2018;
   the Privacy and Electronic Communications Directive 2002/58/EC (as
   updated by Directive 2009/136/EC) and the Privacy and Electronic
   Communications Regulations 2003 (SI 2003/2426) as amended) applies to
   the relationship We have with you and to the data that you are storing
   within Inflex (for example if you are using Inflex for Business
   purposes) then you are the controller of that personal data and We are
   your processor.

   You must ensure that you have the consents or other legal rights in
   place to transfer and store data within Inflex.

   All data is stored by Us in the UK and We will inform you as soon as
   possible if We become aware of any data breach.

   We will only use, process and transfer the data you store in Inflex in
   accordance with your written instructions given by you in your use of
   Inflex and/or in compliance with these terms of use, our Privacy
   Policy or as required by the law. Where We are relying on compliance
   with the law as the basis for processing the personal data We will
   tell you promptly before performing that processing unless those laws
   prevent Us from doing so

10. **The security of your data is vitally important to us.** We have
    appropriate technical and organisational measures to protect
    against unauthorised processing, accidental loss or destruction or
    damage to the data you store within Inflex. We use Microsoft Azure
    to provide our cloud storage. We have entered into a processor
    agreement with them and We comply with the terms of that agreement
    in full. You consent to Us appointing Microsoft Azure as a
    third-party processor of your data under these terms. As between
    you and us, We are liable for all acts or omissions of Microsoft
    Azure and any other third-party processor We appoint.

11. **Our obligations:** Provided you use Inflex in accordance with
    these terms of use and any documentation or guidance We provide
    then, whilst We cannot guarantee that use of Inflex will be error
    free or uninterrupted We undertake that Inflex will be fit for
    purpose, will be of satisfactory quality and will be as described
    in that documentation or guidance. Inflex will be available to you
    unless We are carrying out maintenance (see the wording above
    dealing with this) or unless it cannot be provided for reasons
    beyond our control. In all cases, if it is not available We will
    have it back and running properly as soon as We can.

    We have in place and will maintain all necessary licences, consents
    and other permissions We need to provide Inflex to you

12. **Our responsibility for loss or damage you suffer:** Unless it
    says otherwise in these terms of use, you are responsible for your
    use of Inflex, the information and data you store in it and the
    conclusions your draw or reach for your use of it.

    We do not exclude or limit our liability to you where We are not
    allowed to do so by law. However, We will only be liable for
    foreseeable loss or damage you suffer as a result of our breach of
    these terms of use. If you are a consumer user of Inflex then We do
    not expect you to be using Inflex for any purpose that could give rise
    to your loss of profits or loss of business, loss or business
    opportunity or business interruption so We will not be liable to you
    if you incur such losses whether you are a consumer of business
    user. Loss or damage is foreseeable if it is obvious that it will
    happen.

13. **Ending this agreement:** We will only end this agreement is you
    breach its terms and in particular the Inflex Fair Use Policy as
    described above. If We end this agreement then We will give you
    notice of the date that your access to Inflex will end. In some
    circumstances, this may be with immediate effect.

    agreement during or at the end of your period then please let Us know
    by contacting Us at the email address above. In that case We will not
    take your subscription payment but you will be able to log in to
    Inflex but not edit or create content and your data will be deleted
    after 6 months (see clause 2 above).

    If you want to end the agreement because We or Inflex does not comply
    with these terms of use or because of something We have done or have
    told you We are going to do then please let Us know at the email
    address above and We will refund the proportion of your subscription
    payment that covers the period after the end of the agreement.

    In all other cases you may tell Us that you are ending the agreement
    by contacting Us at the email address above. In these circumstances
    you will not be entitled to a refund of any part of your subscription.

14. **Other important terms**

    **Even if We delay in enforcing this contract, We can still enforce it
      later.** If We do not insist immediately that you do anything you
      are required to do under these terms of use, or if We delay in
      taking steps against you in respect of your breaking this agreement,
      that will not mean that you do not have to do those things and it
      will not prevent Us taking steps against you at a later date.

    **We may transfer this agreement to someone else.** We may transfer
      our rights and obligations under these terms of use to another
      organisation. We will always tell you in writing if this happens and
      We will ensure that the transfer will not affect your rights under
      the contract.

    **You may not transfer your rights to someone else**. You may not
      transfer your rights or your obligations under these terms of use to
      another person.

    **Nobody else has any rights under this contract**. This contract is
      between you and Us. No other person shall have any rights to enforce
      any of its terms.

    **If a court finds part of this contract illegal, the rest will
      continue in force.** Each of the paragraphs of these terms operates
      separately. If any court or relevant authority decides that any of
      them are unlawful, the remaining paragraphs will remain in full
      force and effect.

      proceedings.** These terms of use are governed by English law and

      proceedings in respect of the products in either the Scottish or the
      English courts. If you live in Northern Ireland you can bring legal
      proceedings in respect of the products in either the Northern Irish
      or the English courts.

    **Amicable dispute resolution**

    amicably.

    While your right to take legal action shall always remain unaffected,
    in the event of any controversy regarding the use of Inflex, you can
    contact Us at the contact details provided above.

## Who We Are

We are Sky Above Limited (registered in England and Wales under
company number 12447208) and we are the controller and are responsible
for your personal data. If you have any questions about this policy or
our privacy practices please contact support@inflex.io.

## General Goals

Our general attitude towards data privacy is to restrict our exposure
to any unneeded personal data as far as possible. We will collect
personal data only to make our systems and products function and no
more. We support and comply with the GDPR and data privacy and
protection law. We keep our privacy policy under regular
review. Please keep us informed if your personal data changes during
your relationship with us.

## Third Party Links

Our website and products may include links to third-party websites,
plug-ins and applications. Clicking on those links or enabling those
connections may allow third parties to collect or share data about
you. We do not control these third-party websites and are not
responsible for their privacy statements. When you leave our website,
we encourage you to read the privacy policy of every website you
visit.

Please note that [Stripe](https://stripe.com/) provides our payment
services and protects us against fraudulent payments to the best of
their abilities. They are responsible for payment card processing,
including the collection of billing details, the card number, CVV and
the name on card. For each of our customers we receive from Stripe
only a unique customer ID determined by them.

Your email address is shared with Stripe for emails like payment
invoice notifications, cancellation confirmations, trial expiration,
etc. Stripe collects personal information like your address and
postcode and card details to process payments and for their own
purposes. **Stripeâ€™s own privacy policy will apply to your relations
with them.** Stripe gives us the ability to view a limited amount of
their records about our customers. In particular this includes your
name, the last four digits of your card number, the expiry date of the
card and your post code. We do not routinely access this information
but we may do so from time-to-time to ensure the relationship with
each of our customers is properly and effectively managed. We do not
retain this information ourselves.

## Personal information

Personal data, or personal information, means any information about an
individual from which that person can be identified. It does not
include data where the identity has been removed (anonymous data).

We may collect, use, store and transfer different kinds of personal
data about you. This data is only collected from information that you
give us or from your use of our services and products. We have grouped
the different kinds together as follows:

* Profile Data includes: your username and password, purchases or
  orders made by you, preferences, feedback and survey responses.

* Technical Data includes: internet protocol (IP) address, your login
  data, browser type and version, time zone setting and location,
  browser plug-in types and versions, operating system and platform,
  and other technology on the devices you use to access this website.

* Usage Data includes: information about how you use our website,
  products and services.

We also collect, use and share Aggregated Data such as statistical or
demographic data for any purpose. Aggregated Data could be derived
from your personal data but is not considered personal data in law as
this data will not directly or indirectly reveal your identity. For
example, we may aggregate your Usage Data to calculate the percentage
of users accessing a specific product feature or using our website at
any given time or to help us identify actions to improve the users
experience or improve our products and services. However, if we
combine or connect Aggregated Data with your personal data so that it
can directly or indirectly identify you, we treat the combined data as
personal data which will be used in accordance with this privacy
policy. That Aggregated Data (non-personal) will be shared with
analytics third parties.

We do not collect any special categories of personal data about you
(this includes details about your race or ethnicity, religious or
philosophical beliefs, sex life, sexual orientation, political
opinions, trade union membership, information about your health, and
genetic and biometric data). Nor do we collect any information about
criminal convictions and offences.

We will not track users using cookies (commonly used for advertising and analytics).

## How and Why We Use Your Personal Data

We will only use your personal data when the law allows us to. Most
commonly, we will use your personal data in the following
circumstances:

* Where we need to perform the contract we are about to enter into or
  have entered into with you.

* Where it is necessary for our legitimate interests (or those of a
  third party) and your interests and fundamental rights do not
  override those interests.

* Where we need to comply with a legal obligation.

We have provided more information in the table below:

We will only use your personal data for the purposes for which we
collected it, unless we reasonably consider that we need to use it for
another reason and that reason is compatible with the original
purpose. If you wish to get an explanation as to how the processing
for the new purpose is compatible with the original purpose, please
contact us.

If we need to use your personal data for an unrelated purpose, we will
notify you and we will explain the legal basis which allows us to do
so.

Please note that we may process your personal data without your
knowledge or consent, in compliance with the above rules, where this
is required or permitted by law.

## Personal Data In The Document Editor

We will store all data provided by the user in the document editor
itself, including revisions/history. This data may or may not include
personal information; this is the choice of you, the user. But
whatever is submitted can only be viewed by you as the user and, where
necessary, and by approval by the user, the administrator/developer of
the software in the case of debugging/ error or performance
investigations.

## Overseas Transfers

Whenever we transfer data out of the EEA, we ensure a similar degree
of protection is afforded to it by ensuring at least one of the
following safeguards is implemented:

* We will only transfer your personal data to countries that have been
  deemed to provide an adequate level of protection for personal data
  by the European Commission. For further details, see European
  Commission: Adequacy of the protection of personal data in non-EU
  countries.

* Where we use certain service providers, we may use specific
  contracts approved by the European Commission which give personal
  data the same protection it has in Europe. For further details, see
  European Commission: Model contracts for the transfer of personal
  data to third countries.

* Where we use providers based in the US, we may transfer data to them
  if they are part of the Privacy Shield which requires them to
  provide similar protection to personal data shared between Europe
  and the US. For further details, see European Commission: EU-US
  Privacy Shield.

## Data retention

We will only retain your personal data for as long as reasonably
necessary to fulfil the purposes we collected it for, including for
the purposes of satisfying any legal, regulatory, tax, accounting or
reporting requirements. We may retain your personal data for a longer
period in the event of a complaint or if we reasonably believe there
is a prospect of litigation in respect to our relationship with you.

To determine the appropriate retention period for personal data, we
consider the amount, nature and sensitivity of the personal data, the
potential risk of harm from unauthorised use or disclosure of your
personal data, the purposes for which we process your personal data
and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the
applicable legal, regulatory, tax, accounting or other requirements.

Please contact us if you wish to take advantage of these
rights. Please note after an account has been deleted:

* Data will be removed from the current running system immediately.

* Caches and ambient retained data will take 1 day to be garbage
  collected.

* There will be 100 days before backups are deleted.

* Logs related to card payments within the Stripe system will not be
  deleted, as they are necessary for accounting purposes. Refer to
  [Stripe's privacy policy](https://stripe.com/gb/privacy) on this.

* In addition, general system logs will have a retention period of 7
  days days before they are deleted entirely from the system.

## Your rights

Under certain circumstances, you have the following rights under data
protection laws in relation to your personal data:

* Request access to your personal data

* Request correction of your personal data

* Request erasure of your personal data

* Object to processing of your personal data

* Request restriction of processing your personal data

* Request transfer of your personal data

* Right to withdraw consent

You will not have to pay a fee to access your personal data (or to
exercise any of the other rights). However, we may charge a reasonable
fee if your request is clearly unfounded, repetitive or
excessive. Alternatively, we could refuse to comply with your request
in these circumstances.

We may need to request specific information from you to help us
confirm your identity and ensure your right to access your personal
data (or to exercise any of your other rights). This is a security
measure to ensure that personal data is not disclosed to any person
who has no right to receive it. We may also contact you to ask you for
further information in relation to your request to speed up our
response.

We try to respond to all legitimate requests within one
month. Occasionally it could take us longer than a month if your
request is particularly complex or you have made a number of
requests. In this case, we will notify you and keep you updated.

We will notify you if we detect any data breaches of your data
alongside a report of the steps we have taken in response and to
mitigate the impact.

You have the right to make a complaint at any time to the Information
Commissioner's Office (ICO), the UK supervisory authority for data
protection issues (www.ico.org.uk). We would, however, appreciate the
chance to deal with your concerns before you approach the ICO so
please contact us in the first instance.

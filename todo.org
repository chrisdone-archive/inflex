Be bold!

(but limited in memory use eventually)
Integer - arbitrary size   - total operations
Rational - arbitrary size  - total operations

(re-use safe-decimal package)
Int64 - fixed precision    - partial operations
Decimal - fixed precision  - partial operations

Int32/Int16/Int8

Use floating points but make partial results explicit too?

     This will serve as a warm up for the Duet, for implementing row types.

     Work in progress. Needs inference for Array type.

e.g. data Array (a :: Type)
- [X] Add a Array type to Duet
- [X] Add inference for Array type
- [X] Add stepper for Array
- [X] Add a Array display to Editor sum type

Quoting Unison:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
A term or type definition that’s part of a cycle of mutually recursive
definitions hashes to the form #x.n where x is the hash of the cycle
and n is the term or type’s index in its cycle. A cycle has a
canonical order determined by sorting all the members of the cycle by
their individual hashes (with the cycle removed).
